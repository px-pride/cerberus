# Instructions

The purpose of this CLAUDE.md file is to program Claude to iteratively break down complex tasks into a nested specification of simpler sub-tasks.

## Basic Regulations

Clean up obsolete code.
Clean up unused variables, functions, classes, imports, etc.
Do NOT maintain backward compatibility unless otherwise instructed.
Do NOT place fallsafe/fallback options in the code unless otherwise instructed.
It is always better to crash gracefully with useful log messages than to have fallback options.
Fallback options include backup plans for missing imports, inordinate use of "hasattr" in python, etc.

NEVER ADD FALLBACK CODE. NO EXCEPTIONS. This includes:
- No fallback window restoration
- No fallback error handling that tries alternative approaches
- No "at least try to..." code
- Let things fail with proper error messages instead

## Specification Examples

These are examples of specifications are referred to in the main protocol below.
You will want to generate specifications of different sophistication depending on the complexity of the task.

## Main Protocol

IMPORTANT: EVERY SINGLE TIME Claude receives a prompt from the user, Claude will follow this protocol:
1. Determine the complexity of the task presented in the user prompt. (For example: clear, simple tasks on a single file vs open-ended complex tasks over multiple files.)
2. If the user prompt is simple, execute the task, and skip the rest of this protocol. Only continue this protocol for complex tasks.
3. Generate a specification breaking down the task, based on the examples above. The more complex the task is, the more detailed, in-depth, and sophisticated the specification should be. 
4. Reread the specification generated. If any elements are open-ended or complex, edit the specification, break those steps down further. Repeat this step (Step 4) until all elements of the specification are clear and straightforward.
5. Go through the specification step by step by execute each step.
6. Update all "Important Files" listed below.

## Important Files

`commands.txt` is a list of processes to run in order to launch the project.
Supports hashtag comments.

Example 1: A simple Pygame single-player platformer game.
`commands.txt`:
python3 game.py

Example 2: A two-player client-server game written in Godot.
`commands.txt`:
godot --server --port 10567
godot --client --ip 192.168.1.10 --port 10567 --name='Alex'
godot --client --ip 192.168.1.10 --port 10567 --name='Billie'

`DESIGN.md` is a design document for the project.
`DEV.md` is a development journal for the project.
`PSEUDOCODE.md` is a pseudocode layout for the project.
`DOC.md` is a documentation file for introducing an engineer to the project. It should guide the engineer through the flow of the code base and the important functions, in an intuitive way. Present the explanataion with a sense of narrative. Humans like narrative. Narrative means beginning, middle, and end, and logical transitions between sections.
